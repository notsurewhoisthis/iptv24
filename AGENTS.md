# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- `src/` holds Astro pages, layouts, components, and content collections.
- `src/data/` stores programmatic datasets (apps, devices, comparisons, authors).
- `src/content/` contains Markdown collections (`blog/`, `guides/`, `troubleshooting/`).
- `public/` is for static assets (images, icons, robots, etc.).
- `scripts/` contains data refresh utilities for App Store and Google Play.
- `.github/workflows/` includes CI and scheduled update automation.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `npm run dev`: local dev server.
- `npm run build`: production build output to `dist/`.
- `npm run preview`: serve the production build locally.
- `npm run lint`: ESLint checks.
- `npm run format` / `npm run format:check`: Prettier formatting.
- `npm run check`: lint + format check + `astro check`.
- `npm run update:apps`: refresh iOS/macOS app data.
- `npm run update:android-apps`: refresh Android app data.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Follow existing Astro/TypeScript patterns and Tailwind utility usage.
- Keep indentation consistent with the file (typically 2 spaces).
- Prefer descriptive, kebab-case slugs for content files.
- Formatting is handled by Prettier; linting by ESLint.

## Testing Guidelines
- No dedicated test framework is configured yet.
- Use `npm run check` to validate linting and type checks before changes.
- If you add tests, document them in this file and wire a script.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Commit messages are short, imperative, and scoped (e.g., "Add ...", "Fix ...", "chore: ...").
- For PRs: include a brief summary, key pages affected, and screenshots for UI changes.
- Note data updates if `src/data/*.json` changed.

## Security & Configuration Tips
- Environment variables: `SITE_URL`, `WEB3FORMS_KEY`, `PUBLIC_VITALS_ENDPOINT`.
- Do not commit secrets; use GitHub Actions secrets for deploy credentials.
- App data updates are generated by scripts or scheduled workflows. Avoid manual edits.
