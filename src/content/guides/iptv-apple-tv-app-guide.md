Apple TV IPTV apps can look similar at first glance. The real differences show up in playlist handling, buffer control, and how well the app works with the Siri Remote.

## 1) Playlist support

Make sure the app supports your format:

- M3U URL
- Xtream Codes login
- EPG URL (XMLTV)

Some apps accept M3U but ignore EPG. That is a deal-breaker if you watch live TV.

## 2) Stream protocol control

Apps that let you switch between HLS and MPEG-TS give you a practical way to fix stutters. If the app hides the protocol, you lose a major troubleshooting lever.

## 3) Buffer settings

Apple TV apps often default to a short buffer. Set it to 10-15 seconds for live sports. Anything shorter can stutter on peak evenings.

## 4) Remote usability

A good Apple TV app should let you:

- Jump back to the last channel quickly
- Search by channel name without lag
- Favorite channels and keep them on top

If you feel friction after five minutes, you will feel it every day.

## 5) EPG time shift

EPG data is frequently offset by time zone. A clean app exposes a time shift option so you can align listings without editing the EPG file.

## 6) Pricing transparency

Some apps charge monthly, others charge once. If you see a cheap app with hidden add-ons, read the fine print. Apple TV refunds are not guaranteed.

## Short recommendation

Start with an app that supports M3U + Xtream Codes, allows buffer control, and exposes EPG time shift. Those three settings account for most stability improvements.
