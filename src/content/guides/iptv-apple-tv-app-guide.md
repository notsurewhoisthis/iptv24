faq:
  - question: "What is the best IPTV app for Apple TV?"
    answer: "The best IPTV app for Apple TV depends on your needs. For M3U and Xtream Codes support with EPG, apps like IPTVX and iPlayTV are popular choices. Look for apps with buffer control, EPG time shift, and good Siri Remote navigation."
  - question: "Can I use free IPTV apps on Apple TV?"
    answer: "Yes, some free IPTV apps exist on the App Store, but they often have limitations like ads, no EPG support, or restricted features. Paid apps typically offer better stability and more features."
  - question: "Why is my IPTV app buffering on Apple TV?"
    answer: "Buffering on Apple TV is usually caused by insufficient buffer settings (increase to 10-15 seconds), slow internet connection, or ISP throttling. Using Ethernet instead of Wi-Fi and trying a VPN can help."
  - question: "Do Apple TV IPTV apps support 4K streaming?"
    answer: "Yes, most modern Apple TV IPTV apps support 4K streaming if your IPTV provider offers 4K channels. Ensure you have an Apple TV 4K model and at least 25 Mbps internet speed."
  - question: "How do I add an M3U playlist to Apple TV?"
    answer: "Open your IPTV app, go to Settings or Add Playlist, select M3U URL option, paste your playlist URL, and save. The app will download and parse the channel list, which may take 1-2 minutes for large playlists."

Apple TV IPTV apps can look similar at first glance. The real differences show up in playlist handling, buffer control, and how well the app works with the Siri Remote.

## 1) Playlist support

Make sure the app supports your format:

- M3U URL
- Xtream Codes login
- EPG URL (XMLTV)

Some apps accept M3U but ignore EPG. That is a deal-breaker if you watch live TV.

## 2) Stream protocol control

Apps that let you switch between HLS and MPEG-TS give you a practical way to fix stutters. If the app hides the protocol, you lose a major troubleshooting lever.

## 3) Buffer settings

Apple TV apps often default to a short buffer. Set it to 10-15 seconds for live sports. Anything shorter can stutter on peak evenings.

## 4) Remote usability

A good Apple TV app should let you:

- Jump back to the last channel quickly
- Search by channel name without lag
- Favorite channels and keep them on top

If you feel friction after five minutes, you will feel it every day.

## 5) EPG time shift

EPG data is frequently offset by time zone. A clean app exposes a time shift option so you can align listings without editing the EPG file.

## 6) Pricing transparency

Some apps charge monthly, others charge once. If you see a cheap app with hidden add-ons, read the fine print. Apple TV refunds are not guaranteed.

## Short recommendation

Start with an app that supports M3U + Xtream Codes, allows buffer control, and exposes EPG time shift. Those three settings account for most stability improvements.
