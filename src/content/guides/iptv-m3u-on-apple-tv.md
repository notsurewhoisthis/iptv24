Use these steps to add an M3U playlist on Apple TV without losing EPG data or playback stability.

## Step 1: Open your IPTV app

Choose a player that supports M3U and EPG. If the app only accepts Xtream Codes, you will need a different player.

## Step 2: Add the M3U URL

- Go to Add Playlist.
- Paste the M3U URL and give it a short name.
- Save and wait for the channel list to load.

If the app allows it, disable poster art during the first sync. Large playlists load faster.

## Step 3: Add the EPG URL

- Open the Guide or EPG settings.
- Paste your EPG URL (XMLTV).
- Set an EPG time shift if listings are off by one hour.

## Step 4: Verify playback

Open a known 1080p channel and let it play for 2-3 minutes. If you see quick stutters, increase the buffer to 10-15 seconds.

## Common issues

- **Blank channels:** the M3U link might be expired. Ask your provider for a fresh URL.
- **No EPG:** confirm the EPG URL is an XMLTV file, not a web page.
- **Audio delay:** toggle HLS vs MPEG-TS in app settings.

Once the playlist plays smoothly, you can favorite channels and customize the order. For full device setup, use the Apple TV 4K IPTV guide.
