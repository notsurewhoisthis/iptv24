Use this checklist to set up IPTV on any MacBook. It focuses on playlist import, EPG sync, and playback stability.

## Step 1: Install a Mac IPTV player

Pick a player that supports M3U, Xtream Codes, and EPG. If it only supports M3U, you can still use it, but you may lose advanced login options.

## Step 2: Add your playlist

- Open the app and choose Add Playlist
- Paste your M3U URL or enter Xtream Codes credentials
- Save and wait for the channel list to load

## Step 3: Sync EPG

Paste the EPG XMLTV link and refresh the guide. If the guide is off by one hour, apply a time shift in the settings.

## Step 4: Playback tuning

- Buffer: 8-12 seconds for live streams
- Protocol: HLS if available
- Audio: switch output to MacBook speakers if you hear a delay on Bluetooth

## Step 5: Quick test

Play two live channels and one VOD item. If the app freezes, reduce playlist images or disable animated artwork.
