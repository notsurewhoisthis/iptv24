EPG offsets are common when your device time zone does not match the provider data.

Most apps include a +/- hour offset setting. Adjust and refresh the guide to confirm.

Daylight saving changes often require a temporary time shift update.

## Quick checklist

- Check device time zone settings.
- Apply a +1 or -1 hour offset in the app.
- Refresh the EPG after changing the offset.

## Common pitfalls

- Changing the device time without refreshing the EPG.
- Using multiple EPG sources with different time zones.
