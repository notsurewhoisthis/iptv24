Low quality usually comes from low bitrate streams or network congestion.

Test the same channel on another device to confirm whether the issue is the stream source.

Switch to a higher bitrate channel if available, and use Ethernet to stabilize throughput.

## Quick checklist

- Check if the provider offers multiple stream qualities.
- Use Ethernet or stronger Wi-Fi for high-bitrate channels.
- Disable VPN if it reduces bandwidth.

## Common pitfalls

- Assuming 4K automatically equals high quality.
- Overloading Wi-Fi with multiple devices during live viewing.
