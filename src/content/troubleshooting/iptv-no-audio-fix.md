No-audio issues often come from unsupported audio codecs or wrong output settings.

Switch audio tracks inside the app and test stereo output to isolate the issue.

If the issue appears only on a few channels, the stream audio may be broken.

## Quick checklist

- Switch audio tracks in the player.
- Disable surround output temporarily.
- Test another channel to confirm the source.

## Common pitfalls

- Assuming the device is broken when it is a stream issue.
- Leaving Bluetooth audio on when latency is high.
