If a provider limits concurrent streams, new logins may be blocked when too many devices are active.

Log out of unused devices and confirm your subscription tier.

Some providers offer multi-connection upgrades for larger households.

## Quick checklist

- Log out of unused devices.
- Confirm your plan connection limits.
- Upgrade to a multi-connection plan if needed.

## Common pitfalls

- Leaving old devices logged in permanently.
- Attempting multiple 4K streams on a single-connection plan.
