Sometimes app updates introduce bugs or reset settings. Start by checking buffer and decoder settings.

Clear cache, re-import the playlist, and restart the device to rebuild the app state.

If the issue persists, contact the app developer or use a backup app until the next update.

## Quick checklist

- Restart the app and device after updates.
- Re-enter playlist and EPG URLs.
- Report the bug to the app developer.

## Common pitfalls

- Ignoring release notes that mention playback changes.
- Assuming the provider is at fault without testing older app versions.
