Codec issues appear when the device cannot decode the video stream. You may hear audio but see a black screen.

Switching between hardware and software decoding in the app can restore playback.

If possible, request an alternate stream from your provider with a different codec.

## Quick checklist

- Toggle hardware decoding in the app settings.
- Switch to a different channel to compare results.
- Update the app to the latest version.

## Common pitfalls

- Assuming the TV is broken when it is a codec mismatch.
- Using outdated apps that lack newer codec support.
