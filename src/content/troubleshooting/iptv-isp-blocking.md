When IPTV only fails on one network, the ISP or DNS settings are likely interfering with the stream.

Switch DNS providers or test with a VPN to confirm the issue.

If the stream works elsewhere, report the block to your ISP or provider.

## Quick checklist

- Test IPTV on mobile data as a baseline.
- Switch DNS to a public resolver.
- Try a VPN to confirm blocking.

## Common pitfalls

- Resetting the app without testing network differences.
- Assuming the provider is down when the ISP is blocking.
