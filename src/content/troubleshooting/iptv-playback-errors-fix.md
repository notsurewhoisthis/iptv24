Playback errors usually point to a stream URL issue, a blocked connection, or an unsupported format. Start by testing a second channel and confirming the playlist is active.

If the error appears on every channel, verify the playlist URL and credentials. If it appears only on one channel, the stream source may be down.

Clear app cache, reload the playlist, and try switching between HLS and MPEG-TS if the app allows it.

## Quick checklist

- Test two or three channels to isolate the stream source.
- Re-import the playlist to rebuild the channel list.
- Switch stream protocol and try again.

## Common pitfalls

- Assuming the app is broken when the provider is down.
- Using expired playlists that still appear to load.
