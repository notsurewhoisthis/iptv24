HDMI handshake issues often appear after OS updates or when switching HDR modes.

Use a high-quality HDMI cable, and test a different TV input to confirm the issue.

Disable HDR temporarily to see if the stream appears.

## Quick checklist

- Swap the HDMI cable and port.
- Disable HDR output to test compatibility.
- Reboot the TV and streaming box.

## Common pitfalls

- Assuming the IPTV app is broken when it is an HDMI issue.
- Using older HDMI cables for HDR streams.
