Invalid M3U URLs usually point to expired tokens or incorrect server links.

Open the URL in a browser to verify it loads text data instead of an error page.

If the provider rotated URLs, request the new playlist link and re-import it.

## Quick checklist

- Remove extra spaces from the URL.
- Open the link in a browser to confirm it loads.
- Request a refreshed URL if it returns 404.

## Common pitfalls

- Saving old URLs after a provider migration.
- Copying incomplete links from emails or chats.
