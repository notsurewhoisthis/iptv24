When VOD fails, the issue is often unrelated to live channels. Many providers host VOD on separate servers, so a single outage can wipe out the movie catalog.

## Start with quick checks

- Refresh the VOD section or reload the playlist.
- Switch to another VOD title to confirm if the issue is catalog-wide.
- Restart the app to clear cached data.

## Confirm the VOD endpoint

If your provider uses Xtream Codes, verify that the VOD endpoint is included in the account. Some plans separate live and VOD access.

## Test on another device

If VOD plays on a second device, the issue is likely app-side. Clear cache, log out, and log back in.

## Contact the provider

Ask if VOD is temporarily offline or if your account requires a different VOD URL. Providers frequently rotate endpoints during maintenance.
