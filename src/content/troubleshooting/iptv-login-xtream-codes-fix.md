Login errors are usually caused by one of three issues: incorrect server URL, expired credentials, or extra whitespace in the fields. Fix those first before changing devices or apps.

## 1. Recheck the server URL

Copy the URL directly from your provider and remove any trailing spaces. A single extra character can trigger "invalid URL" errors.

## 2. Verify your credentials

For Xtream Codes, confirm **username**, **password**, and **server address** are correct. If your provider recently rotated credentials, the old login will fail instantly.

## 3. Test with another device

If the same login fails on two devices, the issue is almost always the server or account status. That narrows the troubleshooting scope quickly.

## 4. Check for account limits

Some providers limit the number of concurrent connections. If another device is streaming, the login may be blocked until the other session ends.

## 5. Ask for a fresh URL

When all else fails, ask for a renewed playlist or a backup server. Many providers maintain alternate domains for outages.
