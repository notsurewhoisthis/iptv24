Streaming devices with limited storage can crash when large EPG files sync.

Clear app cache, delete unused apps, and reduce playlist size to recover space.

Consider a device upgrade if storage limits keep recurring.

## Quick checklist

- Clear IPTV app cache and data.
- Remove unused apps and old downloads.
- Trim playlists and EPG files.

## Common pitfalls

- Syncing huge playlists on 8GB devices.
- Ignoring storage warnings until the app fails.
