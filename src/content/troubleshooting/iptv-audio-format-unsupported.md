Some channels use AC3 or E-AC3 audio that older devices cannot decode.

Switch to a different audio track or force stereo output to restore sound.

Updating the app or device firmware can add codec support.

## Quick checklist

- Switch audio tracks within the player.
- Disable surround output temporarily.
- Update the app and device firmware.

## Common pitfalls

- Assuming a channel is broken instead of checking audio format.
- Using Bluetooth audio where codecs are limited.
