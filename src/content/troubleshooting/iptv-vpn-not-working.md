VPNs can add latency or trigger provider blocks. If streams fail only on VPN, you need to adjust the setup.

Switch VPN servers, test different protocols, and consider split tunneling to reduce latency.

If all VPN servers fail, contact your provider about VPN support.

## Quick checklist

- Switch to a nearby VPN server.
- Test HLS instead of MPEG-TS.
- Enable split tunneling if available.

## Common pitfalls

- Using faraway VPN servers that add latency.
- Assuming VPN is required when it is not.
