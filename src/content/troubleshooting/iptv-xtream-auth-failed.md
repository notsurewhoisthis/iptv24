Authentication errors usually mean the server URL, username, or password is incorrect.

Confirm details with your provider and test the login on a second device.

If the login works elsewhere, check for VPN or IP blocks.

## Quick checklist

- Re-enter username, password, and server URL.
- Disable VPN to test without routing changes.
- Ask for a password reset if the account expired.

## Common pitfalls

- Using the wrong protocol (HTTP vs HTTPS).
- Leaving trailing spaces in login fields.
