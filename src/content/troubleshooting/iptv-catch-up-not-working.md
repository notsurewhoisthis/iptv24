Catch-up relies on provider support and correct EPG metadata. If it is missing, your app may not show replay options.

Confirm the channel supports catch-up and the EPG is properly synced.

Some apps require a specific playlist flag to enable catch-up links.

## Quick checklist

- Confirm catch-up support with your provider.
- Refresh the EPG and verify time shifts.
- Try a different player app if catch-up stays blank.

## Common pitfalls

- Expecting catch-up on every channel.
- Using players that do not support catch-up tags.
