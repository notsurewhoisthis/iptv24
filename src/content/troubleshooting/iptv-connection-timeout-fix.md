Timeouts usually mean the player cannot reach the stream server in time. The cause can be DNS, VPN routing, or provider congestion.

Test the same playlist on a second device and on a different network. If both fail, the provider server may be overloaded.

Try a different DNS provider or disable VPN temporarily to isolate routing issues.

## Quick checklist

- Restart the router and streaming device.
- Disable VPN and test again.
- Switch DNS to a public resolver like 1.1.1.1 or 8.8.8.8.

## Common pitfalls

- Ignoring DNS issues that only appear on one ISP.
- Testing only one device before contacting support.
