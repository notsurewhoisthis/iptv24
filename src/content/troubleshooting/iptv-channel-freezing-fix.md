If a single channel freezes while others work, the stream source is likely unstable.

Test a different channel group or alternate server if your provider offers one.

Switch stream protocol to see if it improves stability.

## Quick checklist

- Test the channel on another device.
- Try HLS vs MPEG-TS on the same channel.
- Ask for an alternate stream source.

## Common pitfalls

- Reinstalling the app when only one channel fails.
- Ignoring server-side issues during live events.
