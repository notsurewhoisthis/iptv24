Slow channel switching often comes from oversized playlists and heavy artwork. Tuning the app and trimming your channel list can make a huge difference.

## Trim the playlist

Ask your provider for a smaller list or remove unused groups in the app. Fewer channels equals faster loading.

## Disable artwork

Channel logos and poster art can slow down list rendering. Turn artwork off while testing speed improvements.

## Clear cache and restart

Cache corruption can add latency. Clear the app cache, reload the playlist, and restart the device.

## Upgrade the network path

If possible, switch to Ethernet or a 5 GHz Wi-Fi network. Channel zapping is sensitive to latency.
