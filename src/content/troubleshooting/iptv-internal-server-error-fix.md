Internal server errors usually point to provider outages or overloaded servers, not your device.

Confirm by testing the playlist on another device or network. If the error persists, it is likely server-side.

Request a backup server URL or wait for the provider to resolve the outage.

## Quick checklist

- Test the playlist on a second device.
- Ask for a backup server endpoint.
- Retry after 15-30 minutes if the provider is overloaded.

## Common pitfalls

- Reinstalling the app when the server is down.
- Changing settings repeatedly without confirming server status.
