Subtitles may be missing because the stream does not include them or the app is set to the wrong language.

Switch subtitle tracks inside the player and refresh the stream to confirm.

If subtitles are missing across many channels, test a different player app.

## Quick checklist

- Switch subtitle tracks in the player settings.
- Restart the stream after changing subtitle options.
- Update the app to the latest version.

## Common pitfalls

- Assuming subtitles are available on every channel.
- Ignoring language settings in the app.
