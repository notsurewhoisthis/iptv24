Playlists can expire when tokens are rotated or subscriptions end. Channels may disappear even if the app still shows the playlist name.

Ask your provider for a refreshed URL or new login credentials, then re-import the playlist.

After updating, clear cache to prevent the old channel list from persisting.

## Quick checklist

- Request a new playlist URL from your provider.
- Remove the old playlist and add the new one.
- Refresh the EPG after re-importing.

## Common pitfalls

- Reloading the same expired playlist URL repeatedly.
- Forgetting to refresh the EPG after updating.
