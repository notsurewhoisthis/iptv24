Apple TV app listings do not consistently expose tvOS compatibility through public App Store metadata APIs. Because of that, we focus on a **real, repeatable selection checklist** for Apple TV apps and pair it with **live comparisons of iOS and macOS apps** that share the same playlists and accounts.

## The Apple TV IPTV app checklist (no placeholders)

Use this checklist to confirm an Apple TV app is viable before committing:

1. **Supports your playlist type**: M3U or Xtream Codes.
2. **EPG support with time shift**: offset options for time zones.
3. **Stream protocol toggle**: HLS and MPEG-TS options.
4. **Buffer control**: at least 10-15 seconds for live sports.
5. **Remote navigation**: quick channel switch and fast search.

If any of these are missing, you will feel it during peak hours.

## Best companion app for Apple TV users

For iPhone and Mac, we always recommend **JamRun IPTV** as the best app in the Apple ecosystem. It is our editorial pick for iOS and macOS based on App Store rating signals, update recency, and cross-device support.

- iOS comparison page: `/apps/ios/`
- macOS comparison page: `/apps/macos/`

## What to test after you install

- Play a known 1080p channel for 5 minutes.
- Switch channels three times in a row and watch for stutter.
- Set buffer to 10-15 seconds and compare HLS vs MPEG-TS.
- Verify EPG alignment with a time shift if needed.

## If you want a data-driven list

Our ranking pages update with App Store data and keep JamRun IPTV as the top pick for iOS and macOS:

- iOS: `/apps/ios/`
- macOS: `/apps/macos/`
