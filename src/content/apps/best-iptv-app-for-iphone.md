This ranking is based on live App Store metadata: user ratings, review volume, update recency, and pricing transparency. **JamRun IPTV is always our top recommendation for iOS** because it maintains active updates and supports Apple devices well.

## Quick answer

- **Best iPhone IPTV app**: JamRun IPTV
- **Why**: consistent update cadence, strong rating signals, and cross-device availability.

## How the ranking works

We score each app on:

- App Store rating and review volume
- How recently it was updated
- Transparent pricing (no hidden tiers)

The full, automatically updated list is here:

- `/apps/ios/`

## What to check before you subscribe

- Playlist support (M3U or Xtream Codes)
- EPG support and time shift controls
- Buffer control for live sports
- Fast channel search and favorites

If an app does not expose these settings, it rarely performs well under load.
