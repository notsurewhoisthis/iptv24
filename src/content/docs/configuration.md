Correct configuration prevents most playback and guide issues.

## Playlist types
- **M3U URL**: paste the full URL exactly as provided.
- **Xtream Codes**: enter server URL, username, and password.
- **Stalker Portal**: enter portal URL and your device MAC address.

## EPG settings
- Use the EPG URL from your provider.
- Set the correct time zone in the app to prevent offset guide data.
- Refresh EPG after changes, then reboot the app if data still looks stale.

## Common mistakes
- Truncating the playlist URL.
- Using HTTP when your provider requires HTTPS.
- Leaving the app in the wrong time zone.

If channels load but guide data does not, start with the EPG troubleshooting guide.
