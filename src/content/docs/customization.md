Once your playlist works, optimize the experience.

## Playback tweaks
- Adjust buffer size only if you see stutter or freezing.
- Prefer hardware decoding when available.
- Disable auto-start for heavy channels you rarely watch.

## Library organization
- Use favorites and small category lists to speed up browsing.
- Hide unused groups to reduce clutter.
- Add channel logos only if your device has enough storage.

## Audio and subtitles
- Pick the correct audio track for multi-language channels.
- Turn on subtitle fallback for noisy environments.

These small changes usually improve day-to-day usage more than any app switch.
