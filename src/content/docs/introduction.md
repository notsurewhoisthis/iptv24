Streaming Guide is an editorial IPTV site focused on apps, devices, comparisons, and troubleshooting. We test playback behavior, document setup steps, and explain fixes in plain language.

## What you will find here
- App pages for iOS, macOS, Android, and Android TV
- Device pages for streaming sticks, boxes, smart TVs, phones, and tablets
- Comparisons that highlight practical tradeoffs
- Step-by-step guides and troubleshooting playbooks

## What we are not
- We do not sell IPTV subscriptions.
- We do not host streams.
- We only document how apps and devices behave when you use your own legal sources.

Use the navigation to jump to your device or your issue. If you are new, start with the setup guide for your platform and come back to troubleshooting only if you hit a specific problem.
