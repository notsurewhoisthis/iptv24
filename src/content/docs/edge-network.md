Most IPTV problems are network problems. Start here before changing apps.

## Fast fixes
- Use Ethernet when possible.
- Restart your router if streams stall or fail to load.
- Move closer to Wi-Fi or switch to 5 GHz.
- Test another app to confirm if the issue is device or stream related.

## ISP blocking
If streams fail on one network but work on another, your ISP may be throttling or blocking.
- Try a reputable VPN.
- Test from mobile data to confirm the pattern.

## DNS
If channel lists fail to load, try a public DNS provider and test again.
