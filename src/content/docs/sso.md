IPTV apps typically support one or more login formats.

## Common formats
- **M3U URL**: a playlist link (sometimes paired with an EPG URL).
- **Xtream Codes**: server URL, username, and password.
- **Stalker Portal**: portal URL and MAC address.

Use the format your provider gives you. Mixing formats is the most common setup mistake.
