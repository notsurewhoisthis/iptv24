Streaming Guide is built on hands-on testing and transparent sources.

## What we test
- App usability, stability, and playlist handling
- Device playback consistency and network behavior
- Real-world troubleshooting workflows

## Sources and citations
We cross-check claims with vendor specs, app store listings, and reputable editorial reviews. When we quote another publication, we link it in the Editor sources block on device pages.

## Update cadence
- App metadata is refreshed on a biweekly schedule.
- Troubleshooting guides are updated when issues change or platforms release new versions.
