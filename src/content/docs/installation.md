This is a short checklist to get IPTV working the right way on day one.

## What you need

- A supported device (phone, tablet, streaming box, or smart TV).
- A stable internet connection.

## Basic steps
1. Pick a player app for your device.
2. Add your playlist or login details.
3. Set your EPG URL if your provider supplies one.
4. Test a mix of live channels and VOD to confirm playback.
5. Save favorites and create a short list for quick access.

If you get stuck, jump to the troubleshooting section for the exact error you see.
